Automated Resume Parsing Using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLP

Introduction:
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a very important task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to find and categorize entity namely, people, organizations, location, dates and etc within texts. Counting entity types in the NER provides a foundational element in information retrieval, question answering system, and content recommendation engine.
Real world application of NER can be best shown through resume parsing domain. Today, organizations are getting many resumes daily which need to sift through for immersion of crucial information in order to cut time of the recruitment processes. NER techniques are used to automatically identify and classify the important key entities from resumes such as:
•	Personal Information: Names, contact details
•	Educational Background: Degrees, institutions attended
•	Professional Experience: Previous job titles, company names
•	Skills: Technical proficiencies, languages
For research and development in this area, the Resume NER Dataset has been curated containing a variety of resumes annotated with 36 different entity categories. This dataset is of great value to train and evaluate the NER models for resume parsing application. Using this dataset, developers can make the functionality of automated systems of leveraging resume data both more accurate and faster, improving any talent acquisition workflow processes.
